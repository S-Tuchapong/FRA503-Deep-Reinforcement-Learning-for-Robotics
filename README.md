## Recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install)

Download Miniconda different version, IsaacLab using python version 3.10 [[list of Miniconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda)].

```
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_24.11.1-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Install Miniconda

```
bash ~/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

The installer finishes and displays, ‚ÄúThank you for installing Miniconda3!‚Äù

Close and re-open your terminal window for the installation to fully take effect, or use the following command to refresh the terminal

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Verifying the Miniconda installation

Test your installation by running `conda list`. If conda has been installed correctly, a list of installed packages appears.

## Installing Isaac Sim & Isaac Lab

### Pip Installation (recommended for Ubuntu 22.04)

Follow the Installing and Verifying steps [[link](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/pip_installation.html)]

### Binary Installation (recommended for Ubuntu 20.04)

Follow the Installing and Verifying steps [[link](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/binaries_installation.html)]

### Verifying the Isaac Lab installation

```
# Option 1: Using the isaaclab.sh executable
# note: this works for both the bundled python and the virtual environment
./isaaclab.sh -p source/standalone/tutorials/00_sim/create_empty.py

# Option 2: Using python in your virtual environment
python source/standalone/tutorials/00_sim/create_empty.py
```
